        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This simple recipe is one nearly everybody can make. All that limits you is what you have on hand.</p>
        <p>Simple. Delicous. Easy.</p>
        <p>Whether you're a novice or a professional, this recipe is one you should try this out! While the Philly natives may yell at me about desecrating their dear sandwich, I would love for them to know this:</p>
        <p>I don't care.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Quick Note: meat can be changed to your preference. What I'm putting down is only what I used personally.</p>
        <p>Seasonings are also not set in stone. They can be changed out for what <em>you</em> want.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place oil into the pan and heat it to medium-high.</li>
            <li>Place peppers and onions into the pan and cook for a few minutes (3 to 5, by my estimate) while seasoning with black pepper and salt.</li>
            <li>Remove peppers and onions from the pan and place them into a bowl. Add a small amount of oil.</li>
            <li>Place meat into the pan, and let it cook for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Season meat with onion power, garlic powerder, and caramelized onion butter seasoning. This can also work for whatever seasonings you choose.</li>
            <li>Once meat is nearly finished, add the vegetables back to the mixture and cook for about a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat, or place it on low.</li>
            <li>Open the hoagie rolls and place slices of provolone cheese along the inside.</li>
            <li>OPTIONAl: Heat the hoagie rolls until the cheese starts to slightly melt.</li>
            <li>Place the wanted amount of the meat/vegetable mixture onto the hoagie roll on top of the cheese.</li>
            <li>Eat.</li>
        </ol>
